# SynesthesIA

Music-driven generative visuals powered by AI
SynesthesIA is a web app that analyzes MIDI files using machine learning to generate real-time, dynamic, and mathematically-inspired visuals synchronized with music.
It combines audio perception, deep learning, and visual art in a creative AI system.

ðŸ”§ **Built with**: Python, FastAPI, Transformers, Magenta, scikit-learn, p5.js

ðŸŽµ **Music input**: MIDI files

ðŸŽ¨ **Visuals**: Mathematical animations generated via p5.js

ðŸ§  **AI features**:
- Emotion classification from MIDI (trained model)
- Musical structure segmentation (verses, choruses...)
- Transformer model to convert musical sequences into dynamic visual parameters
- Optionally connects to image-generation APIs (OpenAI, Replicate, Hugging Face)

âœ¨ Open-source and built as my TFG in Software Engineering + Personal AI portfolio project.
